<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
DOCTYPE declaration, it essentially tells browsers "Hey, this is an HTML webpage."

This index.html is the homepage, ensuring compatibility, portability,
and clarity across servers and for developers.

Best practice: We use index.html because:
    1. It's the default file servers look for when accessing a directory
    2. It's an industry standard recognized across web servers
    3. Visitors don't need to type the full filename in the URL
    4. It works automatically with domain.com/ without redirects
    5. It maintains consistency across different hosting environments

This helps with:
    - Server compatibility
    - Clean URLs
    - SEO optimization
    - Developer familiarity

<html lang="en">
<!-- Sets the page language to English - helps screen readers, search engines, and spell checkers. -->

<head>
<!-- Head contains "behind-the-scenes" stuff that defines how the page works and looks. -->
    
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- Character encoding tells browser how to decode the page. -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- Viewport makes sure the page looks good on all devices by adjusting to screen size.
    It also affects page rendering and responsiveness. -->

    <title>Home | eOS Lesson Plans</title>
    <!-- Page title, visible in browser tabs, bookmarks, and search engine results.
    Format: [Page Name] | [Site Name] - this pattern helps with SEO and user navigation. -->

    <link rel="icon" href="../favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <!-- Sets the favicon, the little icon you see in browser tabs and bookmarks. -->

    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <!-- Preconnect hints tell the browser to start early connections to external domains,
    speeding up resource loading from those sites.
    - 'crossorigin' enables secure loading from different domains for fonts.gstatic.com;
    Not needed for fonts.googleapis.com since it's just establishing a connection, not loading content. -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/global.css">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Righteous&family=Space+Grotesk:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <!-- Stylesheets:
    - A stylesheet is a file that tells the browser how to style the HTML content.
    - Local stylesheets (loaded first) for speed, then third-party.
    This order prevents local styles from being accidentally overridden by external CSS. -->

    <script src="../js/yin-yang-toggle.js" defer></script>
    <!-- Script for toggling dark/light mode - placed last for better page load performance and security.
    'defer' tells the browser to load the script after the HTML is parsed but before
    the DOMContentLoaded event, improving page load times. -->
