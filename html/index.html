<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
DOCTYPE declaration, it essentially tells browsers "Hey, this is an HTML webpage."

This index.html is the homepage, ensuring compatibility, portability,
and clarity across servers and for developers.

Best practice: We use index.html because:
    1. It's the default file servers look for when accessing a directory
    2. It's an industry standard recognized across web servers
    3. Visitors don't need to type the full filename in the URL
    4. It works automatically with domain.com/ without redirects
    5. It maintains consistency across different hosting environments

This helps with:
    - Server compatibility
    - Clean URLs
    - SEO optimization
    - Developer familiarity

<html lang="en">

        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <!-- Character encoding tells browser how to decode the page. -->

        It also affects page rendering and responsiveness. -->

        <!-- Preconnect hints tell the browser to start early connections to external domains,
        speeding up resource loading from those sites.
        - 'crossorigin' enables secure loading from different domains for fonts.gstatic.com;
        Not needed for fonts.googleapis.com since it's just establishing a connection, not loading content. -->

        <!-- Stylesheets:
        - A stylesheet is a file that tells the browser how to style the HTML content.
        - Local stylesheets (loaded first) for speed, then third-party.
        This order prevents local styles from being accidentally overridden by external CSS. -->

        <script src="../js/yin-yang-toggle.js" defer></script>
        <!-- Script for toggling dark/light mode - placed last for better page load performance and security.
        'defer' tells the browser to load the script after the HTML is parsed but before
        the DOMContentLoaded event, improving page load times. -->

            by providing a description for screen readers, ensuring users with visual impairments
            can understand and use this control. -->
