    Core color palette 🎨 to splash some happy little colors on our canvas.

    You'll see below that each color in our palette gets its own little ID — a code that
    tells the browser what shade to use. This is called a hex code.
    Think of it as a color’s secret ID 🕵️‍♀️ A 6-digit code starting with # (like #4A90E2)
    mixes red, green, and blue (RGB) — two digits each: RRGGBB. You want pure black? #000000.
    Pure white? #FFFFFF. It’s how we talk color to computers.

    🌈 Play with https://coolors.co/ to brainstorm colors for your project.

    Dark mode as default 🌑 — why it’s the base:

    Dark mode cuts glare and reduces eye strain 👀, making screens less of a
    punch to the retinas when you’re staring at code (or memes) for hours.
    It’s a game changer for some, calming overstimulated senses and boosting focus.
    Plus, it’s easier on eyes in dim rooms and might save battery on OLED screens.
    (Think iPhone X or later 📱 — all OLED.)

    This is the core palette, with light mode as the toggleable remix.
  */

  /*
    Primary color: Deep Skyler is a rich, dark blackish-blue color.
    😎 Context: The hex code (#0D1B2A) doesn’t have a standard name, so gave it a personal touch -
    my last name, ‘Schuyler’ (pronounced like ‘Skyler’). The name is a play on:
      - It's dark, almost-black blue vibe, fitting for a dark mode design.
      - A nod to the recent LLM DeepSeek, tying it to tech innovation.
      - No color police here — when a color doesn't have a name, you can just name it!

    ✨ Note: This color offers strong contrast (~10:1 with Muad'Dib #C9C2BA) for
    accessibility in dark mode, reducing eye strain in low-light environments. It meets
    WCAG Level AAA standards (7:1 for normal text), ensuring top-tier readability.

    can help with the complex WCAG calculations.

  /*
    Background and subheader text color: Lapis lazuli — a deep, rich blue color.
    😎 Fun Fact: Historically, lapis lazuli was ground into a pigment known as ultramarine,
    used by Renaissance artists for its vibrant blue hue.

    ✨ Note: This color offers sufficient contrast (~7:1 with White #FFFFFF) for
    accessibility in dark mode, reducing eye strain in low-light environments. It meets

    Header text color: Hermès orange.
    Pronounced 'air-mez' like Air Bud but mez. 🐕🏀

    😎 Context: The Orange Box: Hermès is famous for its iconic orange packaging,
    which started as a happy accident. During World War II, wartime shortages forced
    the company to use the only paper stock available — an orange shade. What began as
    a necessity turned into a brand signature by the 1950s. Today, that vibrant orange
    (often described as a warm, poppy-like hue) is synonymous with luxury and instantly recognizable.

    🎨 Color Variations:
    Different representations of the Hermès orange show how brand colors can vary across mediums:
    #FF6600 - Traditional digital representation, brightest and most saturated.
    #F77F00 - Warmer, more muted variation with red undertones.
    #F37021 - Closest match to physical Hermès packaging, with a "burnt orange" quality.

    ⚠️ Note: Using special characters in CSS variables (like è) isn't recommended as it
    can cause encoding issues. For production, use: --hermes-orange instead.
    I am a renegade which is why we are doing it here. 😝

    😎 Fun teacher facts: In 1989, while at Princeton, Wendy Kopp laid out the vision for

  /*
    Subheader text color: Poppy - a bright, warm red with just the right amount of orange undertone.
    😎 Fun Fact: Poppies close their petals at night and during bad weather, then open them again when 
    conditions improve! They're like natural weather predictors. Ancient sailors actually used to 
    watch poppies to help forecast the weather - if the flowers closed up during the day, 
    they knew a storm might be coming. The flowers' movement is called "nyctinasty" - 
    it's a response to changes in temperature and humidity.
  */

  /*
    Subheader text color: Moonstone inspired, a medium-light blue with a slight gray undertone.
    😎 Fun Context: Moonstone has a unique optical effect called "adularescence" which creates 
    a floating blue-white glow that moves across the stone when tilted. This ethereal effect, 
    resembling moonlight through clouds, led Ancient Romans to believe the stones 
    contained actual captured moonbeams. Moonstone is also one of the three birthstones for June,
    the month Ms. Schuyler was born in! Pearl and alexandrite are the other two.
  */

    Tori header text color: Ruby red.
    😎 Fun Context: Dorothy’s ruby slippers in the 1939 "Wizard of Oz" were silver in

    the yellow brick road — cinema’s most iconic footwear was born.

      - Glinda to Dorothy
