  📚 Curricula.css - 
  Welcome! If you find yourself reading this, here's what you're learning: 
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what transforms a website from a basic structure 
  into a complete visual experience - CSS controls everything from colors and spacing 
  to animations and overall aesthetic.

  This CSS stylesheet serves two purposes:
  😎 Styles the eOS website's curricula pages
  🔧 Acts as an educational tool to explain CSS properties

  We'll use simple analogies like dance moves and football helmets for clarity, 
  keeping the explanations straightforward and easy to understand.
  Warning: Some examples contain terrible jokes 😂 (srry about it)

/* 1. Resets

/*
  Reset - Removes default browser styles.
  Sets all elements to start with a clean base for predictable design.

  Every single thing on the page is an element (like text or buttons).
  Every element has space around it — this is called margin.
  Every element has space inside it — this is called padding.

  Order of Properties: Size it, Space it (Sz Sp)

* {
  /*
    The little asterisk (*) is a CSS superhero! 🦸‍♀️🦸 It targets EVERYTHING on the page -
    every tag, every button, every speck of text.
    Here, we’re using it to wipe out browser defaults and take control,
    perfect for keeping our curricula pages in line.
    Think of it as clearing the stage before the dancers (your content) perform!
  */

  /* --- Size It --- */

  /*
    By default, browsers use content-box, where padding and borders
    add to an element’s width or height, which can screw up layouts.

    With border-box, the width and height you set include padding and borders,
    making your life way easier when designing.

    It’s like telling the browser, “No, I decide what fits where.”

    Padding-left adds 2rem of space *inside* the list, on the left side only.

    Here’s the math:
      - 1rem = the root font size (default is 16px in browsers).
      - So, 2rem = 2 × 16px = 32px of space.
      - If the root font size changes (e.g., to 18px), 2rem becomes 36px.
    Why rem? It scales spacing with font size for a consistent look!
    Think of it as giving the list a little elbow room on the left.
